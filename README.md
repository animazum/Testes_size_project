Genome evolution and data analysis for mammals and sexual traits

Here I will submit the scripts to the MLSP paper

When removing the human there is too much colinearity in our data set... Therefore... 

Lets removeother species... do we do it randomly ???

Analyse the jackknife results .... already calculated.

Using bootstrapping, I need to take the take the traits.


make that when bootstrap without replacement (jackknife) has colinearity give NA values of values of 1
